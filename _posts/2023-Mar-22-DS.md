This post introduces Big O notation and it's related space/time complexity for developers. 

Introduction:
-
Data structures helps to solve the coding problems in an optimal way in terms of running time and amount of space it uses to run the code (space and time complexity).

There are various notations used to measure the effectiveness of an algorithm in terms of time and space complexities. Those are:
1. Big O notation
2. Small O notation
3. Theta notation
4. Gamma notation

Out of these, Big O notation is commonly used for measuring the worst case performance of the algorithm.

Big O notation
-
It is a mathematical notation used in computer science to describe the time taken to run the algorithm when input grows.
